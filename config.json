    "prompt": "Influencers are the new global brands and will dictate where consumers spend their money. Companies that host influencers, support influencers, or build on behalf of influencers will win.",
    "explanation": "Billion dollar brands are being created by influencers: Prime Energy (Logan Paul), Beast Chocolates (Mr. Beast),  Skims (Kim Kardashian), Kylie Cosmetics (Kloe Kardashian), GOOP (Gwyneth Paltrow), ON (Roger Federer)... Influencers are the new consumer staples companies. Their marketing spend is vastly cheaper than a P&G whose brand is losing steam every day. We are only at the beginning, there is a shift in how consumers discover and engage with brands. Influencers now hold significant sway over consumer spending, shaping trends and driving sales across various sectors. Companies that provide platforms for influencers, offer support services, or create tools and products for influencer use are likely to benefit.",
